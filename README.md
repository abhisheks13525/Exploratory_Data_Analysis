# Objective:
- Using the Haberman's Cancer Survival dataset we need to predict whether the patient will survive the cancer or not based on the features.
- Find no of classes , features, datapoints per class
- Performing Univariate analysis (PDF, CDF, Boxplot , voilin plots) to understand which features are useful towards classification.
- Performing bi- variate analysis (scatter plots, pair-plots) to see if combination of features are useful in classification.
- Quantifying the results and writing observations for each section of analysis.
